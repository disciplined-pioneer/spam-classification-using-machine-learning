Nowadays, with the growing popularity of email and mobile messages, the problem of spam is becoming more acute and relevant. Spam is not only intrusive advertising and unwanted messages, but also potentially dangerous security threats, including scams, phishing and viruses. In this context, developing effective spam classification methods becomes an important task to ensure the safety and comfort of users. As part of this project, I am researching various machine learning and text mining techniques with the goal of creating a robust and accurate spam classification algorithm. My goal is not only to recognize spam, but also to minimize false positives, providing effective filtering of unwanted messages with minimal user intervention. This introduction provides an overview of our goals and approaches to the spam classification problem.
